# MPI Assignment #

### To build just use Makefile, I've made it for you 🐱 ###

Once you build you will see three programs:
* parallel_balanced - in takes one argument *s* or *r*, it stands for sorted or random init
* parallel_imbalanced - in takes one argument *s* or *r*, it stands for sorted or random init
* sequential - in takes two arguments: *s* or *r*, it stands for sorted or random init and  *b* or *i*, it stands for test function mode
